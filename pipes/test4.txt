Pop Quizzes, Sociology, Statuesque Games 

I'm getting pretty irritated with college professors deciding that pop quizzes are a good measure of attention paid in class. I recently took a quiz in my Operating Systems class and disapprove of the questions he posed to us. Since many of you are not computer science people let me send an example your way:


What does this mean?
You are given a book on apples. Apples are tasty, crisp, and some people are allergic to the skin (like I am). Now here is a sample question: John has four apples, he consumes one on his way to the car. Now please calculate the mass of the sun to the nearest 1000th.

Now after we got our scores he said he would curve it by adding the average score to everyone's score. But I prematurely celebrated because I did not see the smile plastered on his face. The average score was .0015. But he truncates values to the nearest hundredth, therefore he would add .00 to everyone's score.

Sooooo clever. I chuckled, but inside I was not happy. Oh well, 3 points isn't too big of a deal. I just wanted to rant.

I'm not sure what it is about a laptop in class, but if you're typing in anything other than a word processor, your neighbors will snoop. I find it hilarious. If you're on Facebook, everyone notices. If you're playing a game, everyone notices.

Here's a good game to play (sociological, not computer oriented):
1. Open up your favorite game.
2. Start playing.
3. In 5 minutes see who else is playing that game. Guaranteed that at least one other person will start playing it.
4. Revel in your short lived glory of manipulation.

Oh speaking of sociology games, I thought I'd share another one that I used to play. It was for an assignment in high school. My friend Cody was in the class, and he asked me to come do an assignment with him.

He drove us to the mall. Then we had to stand for one hour in one place, facing each other in the middle of the busiest section (food court). I thought this was a weird game; there's nothing that would happen, I thought naively.

In reality, after about 15 minutes of us standing there, people started coming up to us. They would poke us, wave their hands in front of us, dance, ask us questions, and a hundred other things. There was even one group of people that hugged us and went away. It was the weirdest experience I could've imagined.

I'm not sure why they did, but if you walked into the mall, and someone was just standing there as still as a statue, would you do something? Would you hug them? Would you jump up and down? Would you make out in front of that statue? Yeah that happened too.

Anyway, sociological games are fun. I encourage you to try them if you don't have enough homework to keep you busy.

Pop Quizzes, Sociology, Statuesque Games 

I'm getting pretty irritated with college professors deciding that pop quizzes are a good measure of attention paid in class. I recently took a quiz in my Operating Systems class and disapprove of the questions he posed to us. Since many of you are not computer science people let me send an example your way:


What does this mean?
You are given a book on apples. Apples are tasty, crisp, and some people are allergic to the skin (like I am). Now here is a sample question: John has four apples, he consumes one on his way to the car. Now please calculate the mass of the sun to the nearest 1000th.

Now after we got our scores he said he would curve it by adding the average score to everyone's score. But I prematurely celebrated because I did not see the smile plastered on his face. The average score was .0015. But he truncates values to the nearest hundredth, therefore he would add .00 to everyone's score.

Sooooo clever. I chuckled, but inside I was not happy. Oh well, 3 points isn't too big of a deal. I just wanted to rant.

I'm not sure what it is about a laptop in class, but if you're typing in anything other than a word processor, your neighbors will snoop. I find it hilarious. If you're on Facebook, everyone notices. If you're playing a game, everyone notices.

Here's a good game to play (sociological, not computer oriented):
1. Open up your favorite game.
2. Start playing.
3. In 5 minutes see who else is playing that game. Guaranteed that at least one other person will start playing it.
4. Revel in your short lived glory of manipulation.

Oh speaking of sociology games, I thought I'd share another one that I used to play. It was for an assignment in high school. My friend Cody was in the class, and he asked me to come do an assignment with him.

He drove us to the mall. Then we had to stand for one hour in one place, facing each other in the middle of the busiest section (food court). I thought this was a weird game; there's nothing that would happen, I thought naively.

In reality, after about 15 minutes of us standing there, people started coming up to us. They would poke us, wave their hands in front of us, dance, ask us questions, and a hundred other things. There was even one group of people that hugged us and went away. It was the weirdest experience I could've imagined.

I'm not sure why they did, but if you walked into the mall, and someone was just standing there as still as a statue, would you do something? Would you hug them? Would you jump up and down? Would you make out in front of that statue? Yeah that happened too.

Anyway, sociological games are fun. I encourage you to try them if you don't have enough homework to keep you busy.
